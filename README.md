# kali-docker

Run Kali as a Docker image with X11 forwarding. 

This allows you to run GUI applications such as Bloodhound through X11 on your host machine.

Based on: https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/official-kalilinux-docker-images/

## Note
Keep in mind the security implications with X11 forwarding! https://security.stackexchange.com/a/14817
